analogRGBcontrol: In this project we controled the colors from a RGB led with 3 potentiometers. Every potentiometer was responsible with a 
                  primary color; combining them made new colors. First I initialized the variables (6 for the RGB led and 6 for the 
                  potentiometers). Then I defined the input and output in void start up. In the loop I memorized the value from each 
                  potentiometer for each color, i mapped the values and I used a function (created outside the loop) to set the color.
